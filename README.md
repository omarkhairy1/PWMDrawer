# PWMDrawer
Mini oscilloscope built using ATmega32 and an LCD. It prints the duty cycle and frequency/period in addition to drawing a simple waveform shape.
## Usage
- PWM can be either generated by the same kit (PD7 pin) or from an external kit.
- The MC reads the input at pin PD6.
- The user can choose to display frequency or period (explained in details below).
## User Settings
- FREQ_MODE (main.h): When set, the LCD displays frequency and when cleared the LCD displays the period instead.
